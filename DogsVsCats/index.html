<h1>Dogs are better then cats!</h1>
<p>Dogs are better than cats for so many reasons! They are loyal, friendly, and just plain fun to be around. Dogs will always be there for you, no matter what. They are great listeners and will always offer a shoulder to cry on (or a paw to shake). Dogs are also much more active than cats, so they’ll keep you entertained and help you stay fit. Cats, on the other hand, are lazy, aloof, and often times downright mean. They don’t care about you and will often ignore you when you try to pet them. They are also known for being destructive and messy. So why would anyone want a cat when they could have a dog? Dogs are clearly the superior pet!</p>
